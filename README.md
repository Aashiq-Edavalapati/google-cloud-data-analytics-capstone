# google-cloud-data-analytics-capstone
A real-world capstone project simulating a cloud data analyst role at a FinTech startup. I built a full-stack data solution for the Treasury team to monitor loan health, performance, and growth using BigQuery and Looker. This included data ingestion, transformation, dashboard design, and insight generation.
